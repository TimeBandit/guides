# Starting from Scratch

## Start with features

When you begin to design, dont make the mistake of starting with the shell.
Dont design the shell or the naviagtion first. Start with an actual feature because
you app is actually a collection of features.

### Details come later

Start with low fidelity mockups. Use a sharpie and leave color and type faces with later. Greyscale is good for now.

### Don't design too much

Design the most basic version of what you are after and then make it real. Solve problems you find with someting real, don't imagine what you need up front.

Assume everything will be super hard to implement. So leave nice to have out till later.

### Choose a personality

Look at the site that are visited by the sorts of people you want to reach but don't copy.

### Limit your choices

Choose from 8 to 10 shades and a limited set of font sizes chosen ahead of time. You can have system for lots of things like
Font size

- Font weight
- Line height
- Color
- Margin
- Padding
- Width
- Height
- Box shadowsLimit your choices
- Border radius
- Border width
- Opacity

## Not all elements are equal

Signal the relevent importance of elements by de-emphasizing secondary and tertiary elements.

## Size is'nt everything

It would be cruel to expect font size to be soleley responsible for this. Other tools at your disposal are font-weight and background shade and text colour.
Some good content colours would be would:

- Dark colour for primary content
- Grey for secondary content
- Lighter grey for tertiary content

And for font weights:

- Normal of 400/500 for most text
- Empahsize with 600/700

## Don't use grey text on coloured backgrounds

Don't de-emphasize text on a coloured background with grey or opacity. Instead hand pick a colour using the
same hue as the background and adjust the saturations and lightness untill it feels right.

## Empasize by de-emphasizing

Sometimes no matter how you try you cant make an element pop or something else is competing with it. To fix this
you could de-emphasize the other competing items instead of tweaking the element you're trying to hightlight.

## Labels are a last resort

Try to resist the temptation to display key value properties straight from your database. Most of the time it is obvious
what the data is about because of the context or the format or the data e.g \$, @yahoo.co.uk, %. Labels also make it
difficult to create heirarchy. If you really need a label then combine it with the data e.g 'Bedrooms: 2', becomes '3 Bedrooms'.
Use labels where you think the use might be scanning for it such as technical specifications.
