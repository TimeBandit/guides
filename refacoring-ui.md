# Starting from Scratch

## Start with features

When you begin to design, dont make the mistake of starting with the shell.
Dont design or shell or the naviagtion first. Start with an actual feature because
you app is actually a collection of features.

### Details come later

Start with low fidelity mockups. Use a sharpie and leave color and type faces with later. Greyscale is good for now.

### Don't design too much

Design the most basic version of what you are after and then make it real. Solve problems you find with someting real, don't imagine what you need up front.

Assume everything will be super hard to implement. So leave nice to have out till later.

### Choose a personality

Look at the site that are visited by the sorts of people you want to reach but don't copy.
