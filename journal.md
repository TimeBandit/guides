Listening back to the audio of my youtube recording I think I sound like someone
unsure of what he is about to say. As though I am looking for approval before
delivering every sentance. I'm cleary not sure of myself. Hopefully this will
improve with time as I come into my stride with each video and I steadily become
a master.

The night before the new year. I feel as though this is the first year in my life
where I will have meaningful control of my destiny. This being due to the stiving
to develop myself as a person. I an fitter and smarter than this time last year.
I am reading books that have helped me refine my methods and thought. I trust
myself and my choices. This contrasts with the low self esteem that plauged my life
up till this point.
